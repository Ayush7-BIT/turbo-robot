# Contributing to Turbo-Robot

Welcome to Turbo-Robot! We‚Äôre excited to have you contribute to our collection of coding algorithms and solutions. Whether you're participating in Hacktoberfest or just want to enhance this repository, we appreciate your help!

## Getting Started

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:** Click the ‚ÄòFork‚Äô button at the top-right corner of this page to create a copy in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repository:** Run the following command to clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch:** It's best to work in a new branch for each contribution:

   ```
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

4. **Make your changes:** Add new algorithms or improve existing ones. Write clean and well-documented code.

5. **Commit your changes:** Write clear commit messages that explain your changes.

   ```
   git commit -m "Added [algorithm name] or Improved [functionality]"
   ```

6. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your GitHub repository:

   ```
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request:** Go to this repository on GitHub, click ‚ÄúNew Pull Request,‚Äù and follow the instructions.

### What We Expect

- **Clarity:** Code should be well-documented with comments and follow consistent formatting.
- **Efficiency:** Optimize algorithms for performance, and include explanations if needed.
- **Readability:** Ensure code is easy to understand for others.
- **Tested Code:** Test your contributions before submitting a Pull Request.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Check existing contributions to avoid duplicates.
- Each algorithm should include a brief description, time complexity, and use cases in comments or a markdown file.
- No plagiarism: Always give credit for any adapted solutions.
- Focus on common algorithms (like sorting, searching) or well-known problems (like Fibonacci, factorial).

## Hacktoberfest Participation

This repository is part of Hacktoberfest 2024 üéâ! You can contribute by:

- Adding or improving algorithms.
- Fixing bugs or optimizing code.
- Enhancing documentation or examples.

Make sure your contributions follow Hacktoberfest guidelines to be counted towards your total. Quality standards must be met.

# Contributing to turbo-robot

Welcome to the turbo-robot! We’re glad you’re here to contribute to a growing collection of essential coding algorithms and famous code solutions. Whether you’re here for Hacktoberfest or to enhance this repository, we appreciate your efforts!

Getting Started

How to Contribute:

	1.	Fork the repository: Click the ‘Fork’ button at the top-right corner of this page to create a copy of this repository on your GitHub account.

	2.	Clone the repository: Use the command below to clone the forked repository to your local machine:

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

    3.  Create a new branch: It’s recommended to work in a new branch for each contribution.

        git checkout -b feature-branch

    4.  Make your changes: Add new algorithms or enhance the existing ones. Be sure to write clean and well-documented code.

	5.	Commit your changes: Write meaningful commit messages that describe your changes clearly.

        git commit -m "Added [algorithm name] or Improved [functionality]"

    6.  Push your branch: Push your branch to your forked GitHub repository.
    
        git push origin feature-branch

    7.	Create a Pull Request: Navigate to this repository on GitHub, click “New Pull Request,” and follow the prompts.

    What We Expect:

	•	Clarity: Make sure your code is well-documented with comments and follows consistent formatting.
	•	Efficiency: Algorithms should be optimized for performance, with explanations if needed.
	•	Readability: Ensure your code is easy to understand for other contributors or learners.
	•	Tested Code: Please test your contributions before submitting a Pull Request (PR).

Contribution Guidelines

	•	Ensure that your code or improvements are not already present in the repository. Check existing contributions before adding your own.
	•	Each algorithm should have a brief description of its purpose, time complexity, and use cases in the code comments or as a markdown file (if necessary).
	•	No plagiarized content. Always provide credit if you use or adapt existing solutions.
	•	Contributions should focus on common algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming) or well-known problems (e.g., Fibonacci series, factorial) that can help others prepare for interviews or coding challenges.

Hacktoberfest Participation

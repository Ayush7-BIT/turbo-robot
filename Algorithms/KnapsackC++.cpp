/*
The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. The problem gets its name from the scenario of packing items into a knapsack (or backpack) to maximize the value of the items, while staying within a weight or capacity limit. The challenge is to choose the most valuable combination of items without exceeding the knapsack's capacity. The problem has several variations, but the most well-known and studied one is the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

 0/1 Knapsack Problem
In this version, each item can either be included (1) or excluded (0). The decision is binary for each item. You can't take a fraction of an item, nor can you take an item more than once.

Problem Statement:
You have n items, each with:
A weight ùë§ùëñ (how heavy the item is)
A value ùë£ùëñ (how valuable the item is)
The knapsack has a weight capacity ùëä
The goal is to maximize the total value of items in the knapsack without exceeding its weight limit.

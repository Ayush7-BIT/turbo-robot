Here are some of the top data structure questions frequently asked in Python interviews:


1. What are the basic data structures available in Python?
     Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
2. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
      Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed).
3. How do you implement a stack in Python?
      Using lists with append() to push and pop() to remove elements.
4. What is a queue, and how do you implement it in Python?
     A queue follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It can be implemented using collections.deque or lists.
5. Explain the difference between append() and extend() in Python lists.
     append() adds a single element to the end of a list, while extend() adds multiple elements from another iterable.
6. How do you remove duplicates from a list in Python?
     By converting the list to a set and then back to a list: my_list = list(set(my_list)).
7. What are dictionaries in Python?
    Unordered collections of key-value pairs where each key is unique.
8. How do you access elements in a dictionary?
    Using the key inside square brackets or the .get() method.
9. What is the time complexity of inserting and deleting elements in a list?
    The average time complexity is (O(n)) because elements need to be shifted in memory.
10.Explain list slicing in Python.
    List slicing allows accessing a range of elements by specifying a start and end index: my_list[start:end].
